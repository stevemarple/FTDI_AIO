\subsection{Selection of operating voltage for connected device}

\warningbox{Standard Arduino boards which operate at \volt{3.3}
  commonly have the Vcc pin on the ISP interface wired to \volt{5}.
  This is contrary to normal Atmel protocol where the Vcc pin is used
  to select the logic level voltage. If in any doubt over the correct
  setting for Vcc remove the Vcc shunt from JP1.}
