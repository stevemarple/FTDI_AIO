\section{Construction}

Begin construction with IC2, the FT232RL, as this component is the
most difficult and access is easiest with an empty \pcb. Then fit L1,
R1, R2 and R4--R8. Note that R3 should be omitted if you plan to fit
the external \volt{3.3} regulator (IC1). Then fit C3--C7. If using the
external regulator fit C1, C2. Fit the UART connector (X3) and the USB
connector (X2). Then fit the \led{}s, yellow for LED1 (AUX), red for
LED2 (TX) and green for LED3 (RX). Fit X1, the box connector for the
ISP interface; ensure the slotted part is away from the edge of the
\pcb. If using the external regulator fit IC1. Finally add shunts to
JP1 to select the I/O and VCC voltages.
